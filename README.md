The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. 

The singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. 
Sometimes we need to have only one instance of our class for example a single DB connection shared by multiple objects. 
As it decreases the access time and increase the efficiency and performance, singleotn design pattern is implemented.

Basically sometimes there is a common resources which is needed by all the applications, so instead of accessing that common resource eah and every time , we use this single ton pattern
so that only once the object is instantiated , so that there will be no need for creating the object each and every time when we require that resource as it has already been created 
so we can use that instance directly from the memory.
